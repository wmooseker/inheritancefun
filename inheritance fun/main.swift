//inheritance: OOP principle where you can define a hierarchical relationship amongst classes
//a base class AKA super class AKA parent class
//a derived class AKA sub class AKA child class
//a sub class inherits the state and behavior froma super class
//in swift, structs do not support inheritance
//in swift, there is no universal base class
//for example, theres no Object like there is in java
//use the keyword super to refer to a member of the super class
//use the keyword override to override behavior  or state in a sub class
